# Description 

Stock bot was a weekend project designed to get some beginner context on stock trading using python bots. 


This project was done following an awesome blog post by [Roman Paolucci](https://medium.com/swlh/build-an-ai-stock-trading-bot-for-free-4a46bec2a18) - purely for learning purposes.
